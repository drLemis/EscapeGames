crying alone
searching for supplies
stalking another survivor
escaping with a vent shaft
trying to escape from stuck elevator
hear some voices in the distance
try to navigate by map on the wall
procrastinating
draw with chalk on wall
whistling
safely reach the restroom
stares at the wall
trying to remember something important
questioning "Is it for real?" and get no responce
feel a weird fear
feel a headache
feel not so good
feel a strange joy
